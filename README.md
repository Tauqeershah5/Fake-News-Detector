Fake News Detection with Python & Machine Learning

This project is a simple and effective **Fake News Detection System** built using **Python** and **scikit-learn**. It uses machine learning to classify news headlines and articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**.

Features

- Loads and preprocesses real and fake news datasets
- Merges titles and text for improved context
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification
- Classifies custom news inputs with instant results

Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, Train/Test Split)

Dataset

You need two CSV files:
- `fake.csv` (labeled as fake news)
- `true.csv` (labeled as real news)
